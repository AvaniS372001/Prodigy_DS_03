**Commit Title:** Implement Decision Tree Classifier for Bank Marketing Dataset

**Commit Description:** 
- Loaded and preprocessed the bank marketing dataset with appropriate delimiter handling and one-hot encoding for categorical variables. 
- Split the data into training and testing sets, then trained a Decision Tree Classifier with a maximum depth of 5 to enhance visualization clarity. 
- Visualized the decision tree and evaluated model performance using accuracy scores, a classification report, and a confusion matrix.

**Project Overview:**
This project involves analyzing the bank marketing dataset to predict customer responses using a Decision Tree Classifier. The goal is to preprocess the data, train a model, and evaluate its performance.

**Data Preprocessing:**
- Loaded the dataset from a CSV file, ensuring proper handling of delimiters.
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding to prepare the data for modeling.

**Model Training:**
- The dataset was split into training and testing sets (80/20).
- A Decision Tree Classifier was trained with a maximum depth of 5 for clarity in visualization.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- The model was evaluated based on accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix to provide insights into its performance.

**Visualization:**
- A visual representation of the decision tree was created, detailing feature importance and class distributions.

**Installation:**
- Ensure you have the required libraries installed: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`.

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```
