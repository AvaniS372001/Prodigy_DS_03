# Prodigy_DS_03

### Project Overview: This project involves analyzing the bank marketing dataset to predict customer responses using a Decision Tree Classifier. The goal is to preprocess the data, train a model, and evaluate its performance.

### Data Preprocessing:
- Loaded the dataset from a CSV file, ensuring proper handling of delimiters.
Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding to prepare the data for modeling.

### Model Training:
The dataset was split into training and testing sets (80/20).
A Decision Tree Classifier was trained with a maximum depth of 5 for clarity in visualization.

### Evaluation Metrics:
The model was evaluated based on accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix to provide insights into its performance.

### Visualization:
A visual representation of the decision tree was created, detailing feature importance and class distributions.

###Installation:
Ensure you have the required libraries installed: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib.
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
